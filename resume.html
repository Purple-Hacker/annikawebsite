         <h1>Education</h1>
         <h2>Yale University</h2>
         <p>New Haven CT
            December 2021
         </p>
         <p>Bachelor of Science in Astronomy & Physics</p>
         <p>Coursework: Astrostatistics and Data Mining; Research Methods in Astrophysics; Astronomical Observing; Quantum Mechanics</p>
         <h2>Princeton University</h2>
         <p>Princeton NJ
            Summer 2020
         </p>
         <p>Physics of Life Summer Course</p>
         <br>
         <h1>Work Experience</h1>
         <h2>Starfish Space, Simulation Engineer</h2>
         <p>August 2022 - present</p>
         <p>Model physics in a Basilisk physics simulation. One project involved researching how a spacecraft would perform in low Earth orbit, and wrote a model to incapsulate how MSIS drag affects that spacecraft.
Improved performance of the simulation. Sped up and made user use easier of the data processing pipeline of the simulation by half. Improved simulation run times by 20%.
Led a team of five interns to create a new and improved data visualization tool.
         </p>
         <h2>Ski Instructor, Palisades Tahoe</h2>
         <p>January 2022 - May 2022</p>
         <p>Taught three to thirteen year olds how to ski.
         </p>
         <h2>Urry Lab</h2>
         <p>September 2020 - December 2021 </p>
         <p>Mapped galaxy dust distributions of 109 active galactic nuclei (black holes at the center of galaxies) with infrared and optical data from Hubble Space Telescope a year-long thesis with Professor Urry. 
Astronomical data calibration and reduction of FITS files accomplished in Python.
When the research was complete, adapted my code into a publicly hosted GitHub software package so other astronomers could recreate my work and create attenuation (dust) maps of other galaxies as well.
Presented final project at a senior thesis Mellon Forum.
The Paul K. Richter and Evalyn E. Cook Richter Memorial Fund funded this research.
         </p>
         <h2>Newburgh Lab</h2>
         <p>September 2019 – August 2020 </p>
         <p>Created frequency versus intensity graphs of well-known bright stars on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, a telescope developed in 2018. I compared those graphs to theoretical graphs of the same star to find the statistical accuracy of the new telescope; found 3-5 frequency channels of 1024 over- and under-measuring intensity.
Research done in Python, with packages scikit learn, astropy, and scipy, with aid of Cedar supercomputer time.
The Paul K. Richter and Evalyn E. Cook Richter Memorial Fund funded this research.
