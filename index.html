            Hi! I'm Annika Salmi. 
            I am currently pursuing a PhD at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html/"></a>ETH Zurich</a> across 
            three departments (Physics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Environmental Systems Science). I am  
            working on modelling carbon and sulfur cycles on exoplanets.
            <br>
            <br>
            I previously completed a Master's in Planetary Science at Trinity Hall, 
            <a href="https://cam.ac.uk/"></a>University of Cambridge</a>, 
            and worked as a simulation engineer at Starfish Space, modeling the physics of drag. 
            I’m a <a href="https://www.yale.edu/"></a>Yale University</a> graduate in Astronomy 
            and Physics. I grew up in San Francisco, Barcelona, and Zurich, and previously lived 
            in Seattle, Washington.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m also interested in science communication; 
            I have taught astronomy & physics to youth and also have written numerous popular science articles.
            <br>
            <br>
